# Open list public XMPP servers

This open XMPP servers list from site https://xmpp-servers.404.city 
Our task is to create an unbiased directory in which any administrator could include his public server.

## How add new XMPP server site?

To add a new public server, make changes to the [servers.txt](https://github.com/E-404/xmpp-servers/blob/master/servers.txt) file.  Use alphabetical order for convenience.The file is synchronized with the site during the day.

## Conditions for adding to the list.
**1. If the added site does not indicate that it is an XMPP server, the site will not be added to the directory as site XMPP server**

It must be remembered that the directory was created not only for server administrators, but also for sites visitors.

The user who will go to your site should see that this is a public XMPP server site and how to create an account. Explicitly indicate what the site is XMPP server and how to create an account

**Good site example:**

>Hello! The example.com is the site of the public  XMPP server. You can create an account through in-band registration. To do this, use the XMPP client "Name of the XMPP client"

**Good site example:**

>Hello! The example.com is the site of the public XMPP server. You can create an account here example.com/registration

**Bad site example**
>Hello! I John Doe.  I like Kitten and like drink beer. The weather is wonderful. My site is under construction. Ho-ho-ho


If the added site does not indicate that it is an XMPP server, the site will not be added to the directory as site XMPP server.


## Terms of removal from the list

**1. Inactive servers, servers with closed registration can be removed from the list. Servers can be returned back**

**2. The server can be excluded at the request of the server administrator**
