# Open list public XMPP servers

This open XMPP servers list from site https://xmpp-servers.404.city

To add a new public server, make changes to the [servers.txt](https://github.com/E-404/xmpp-servers/blob/master/servers.txt) file.  Use alphabetical order for convenience.
The file is synchronized with the site during the day.

## Conditions for adding to the list.
It is allowed to add any public server with open registration to this list.  On the site that is added to this list must be explicitly stated that this is a public xmpp server and a way to create an account (in-band or web registration).
It makes no sense to add to the list the server on which the visitor is not clear how to create an account
or what is xmpp server. Sites with empty pages or pages with no indication that this is an XMPP server are not accepted.
